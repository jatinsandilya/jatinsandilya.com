# Work 

- Hey👋🏻 I am Jatin! I'm an engineer/entrepreneur who loves building products. I code but I am more T-shaped than usual. I've done product management, early-stage sales, Angel invested (tiny checks $$) in companies and started them.

- OSS (open-source) software & devtools are my jam. Hit me up if you're starting up in this space, I'd love to be an early user. 

- I'm currently working as a Product Engineer @ [Ampersand](https://withamperand.com)
